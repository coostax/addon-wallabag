# Home Assistant Add-on: Wallabag

Wallabag is a web application allowing you to save web pages for later reading. 
Click, save and read it when you want. It extracts content so that you won't be distracted by pop-ups and cie.

Further information can be found at [Wallabag].

## Installation

To install this add-on do the following steps:

1. On supervisor -> add-on go to the options and select Repositories.
1. Add the URL for this repo (https://github.com/coostax/addon-wallabag.git) to the add text box and click on ADD. 
1. Search for the "Wallabag" add-on in the add-on store and install it.
1. Start the "Wallabag" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Wallabag" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
twofactor_auth: true
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of Wallabag
Panel. Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default._

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default._

### Option: `remote_mysql_host`

database.

### Option: `remote_mysql_database`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the name of the database.

### Option: `remote_mysql_username`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the username with permissions.

### Option: `remote_mysql_password`

### Option: `remote_mysql_port`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the port that the database
server is listening on.

### Option: `token_secret`

A secret key that's used to generate certain security-related tokens. You should set this to prevent using the default

### Option: `app_url`

Set APP_URL to the URL Wallabag will be on. For example `https://wallabag.example.com`.

### Option: `app_name`

The name that will appear on the main HTML page. For example `Your wallabag instance`

### Option: `locale`

The locale to set for Wallabag. Rigth now only tested with `en`

### Option: `twofactor_auth`

Enable or disable two factor authentication. For more information check [Wallabag-user-docs]

### Option: `twofactor_sender`

Sender email address for two factor authentication. For more information check [Wallabag-user-docs]

## Database usage

By default, Wallabag will automatically use and configure the Home Assistant
MariaDB addon which should be installed prior to startup, this can be changed
within the configuration to use an external MySql/MariaDB Database. Please note
that there is no easy upgrade path between the two options.
